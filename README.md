**lyapunov-odes-lean: Formal Proofs of Lyapunov Stability Theorems for Autonomous ODEs in Lean 4**

Lean 4 formal proofs of the three classical Lyapunov theorems for autonomous ODEs: Lyapunov stability, asymptotic stability, and exponential decay.

**Zero sorry statements.** Standard axioms only (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

## What this is, and why it matters

This library formalizes classical Lyapunov arguments for autonomous ODEs on real normed vector spaces. Its headline theorem, `lyapunov_asymptotic_stable`, proves asymptotic stability of the origin from ordinary Lyapunov stability hypotheses, a strictly increasing class-K lower bound on the Lyapunov function, and convergence of that function to zero along nearby trajectories.

The convergence mechanism is cleanly separated. The stability theorem keeps sufficiently small initial conditions inside any requested neighborhood. For attraction, the class-K lower bound squeezes the trajectory norm to zero when the Lyapunov values tend to zero. A separate Gronwall theorem proves exponential decay under an appropriate scalar differential inequality.

The LaSalle step is outside the headline theorem: `V(x(t)) -> 0` is assumed explicitly, not derived from a negative orbital derivative. Solutions are global functions satisfying `HasDerivAt`; the library does not prove existence or uniqueness for a particular vector field. The results also do not automatically provide a state-space exponential rate from the scalar Lyapunov bound.

## Background and motivation

Lyapunov's "direct method" is the foundational tool of stability theory: rather than solving an ODE, you exhibit an energy-like function V that decreases along trajectories and read off the stability of an equilibrium from the behaviour of V alone. It underpins control theory, dynamical systems, and the convergence analysis of optimisation and learning dynamics. This library machine-checks the three theorems at the heart of the method — stability, asymptotic stability, and exponential decay — over a general real normed vector space.

## Setting

An autonomous ODE ẋ = f(x) with an equilibrium at x* = 0, over a general real normed vector space `E` (so the results apply to `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` or any Banach space). Solutions are defined via Mathlib's `HasDerivAt`, matching the output format of the Picard–Lindelöf existence theorem (`IsPicardLindelof`).

## Headline theorems

- **`lyapunov_stable`** — Lyapunov stability. If V(0) = 0, V is continuous at 0, positive-definite (bounded below away from the origin), and non-increasing along solutions, then 0 is Lyapunov stable.
- **`lyapunov_asymptotic_stable`** — Asymptotic stability. Stability hypotheses + a class-𝒦 lower bound α(‖x‖) ≤ V(x) + V(x(t)) → 0 along nearby trajectories ⟹ x(t) → 0.
- **`lyapunov_exponential_decay`** — Exponential decay. If V̇(t) ≤ −μ·V(t) with μ ≥ 0, then V(t) ≤ V(a)·e^{−μ(t−a)}.

## Theorem inventory

| # | Name | Statement |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | `IsSolution` | x : ℝ → E solves ẋ = f(x) via `HasDerivAt` (Picard–Lindelöf-compatible) |
| 2 | `LyapunovStable` | ε–δ stability of the equilibrium at 0 |
| 3 | `AsymptoticallyStable` | stable, and nearby trajectories converge to 0 |
| 4 | `lyapunov_stable` | V pos-def + V(0)=0 + continuous at 0 + non-increasing ⟹ stable |
| 5 | `tendsto_zero_of_strictMono_squeeze` | squeeze helper for trajectory convergence |
| 6 | `lyapunov_asymptotic_stable` | stability + class-𝒦 bound + V(x(t))→0 ⟹ x(t)→0 |
| 7 | `hasDerivWithinAt_Ici_liminf_slope` | `HasDerivWithinAt` → liminf-slope bridge for Grönwall |
| 8 | `lyapunov_exponential_decay` | V̇ ≤ −μV (μ ≥ 0) ⟹ V(t) ≤ V(a)·e^{−μ(t−a)} |

## Design notes

- **Solutions via `HasDerivAt`.** `IsSolution` is stated with Mathlib's `HasDerivAt`, the same form produced by the Picard–Lindelöf existence theorem, so the stability results compose directly with existence results.
- **Exponential decay via Grönwall.** `lyapunov_exponential_decay` is derived from Mathlib's `le_gronwallBound_of_liminf_deriv_right_le` (`Mathlib.Analysis.ODE.Gronwall`) — the same core bound used in [contraction-lean](https://github.com/velvetmonkey/contraction-lean) — with `hasDerivWithinAt_Ici_liminf_slope` bridging `HasDerivWithinAt` to the required liminf-slope condition.
- **LaSalle step factored out.** The asymptotic-stability theorem takes the convergence V(x(t)) → 0 as an explicit hypothesis (`hVlim`), factoring out the LaSalle invariance argument (which needs compactness of sublevel sets). This keeps the theorem general; the docstring explains how V̇ < 0 for x ≠ 0 yields `hVlim` under suitable compactness.
